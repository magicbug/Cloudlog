# Cloudlog
> Important: Only accepting PRs on the "dev" branch.

Cloudlog is a self-hosted PHP application that allows you to log your amateur radio contacts anywhere. All you need is a web browser and active internet connection.

While Cloudlog as started by Peter Goodhall, MM9SQL, although since has received a lot of community code contributions. If you would like to contribute to Cloudlog please see the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.

Website: [http://www.cloudlog.co.uk](http://www.cloudlog.co.uk)

## Requirements

- Linux based Operating System
- Apache (Nginx should work)
- PHP Version 7.4 (PHP 8.2 works)
- MySQL (MySQL 5.7 or higher)

Notes

- If you want to log microwave QSOs you will need to use a 64bit operating system.
- We do not provide Docker support, however you are free to use it if you wish but we will not handle support.

## Setup

Installation information can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/magicbug/Cloudlog/wiki).

# Docker Development Environment

This guide provides instructions for setting up a local development environment using Docker and Docker Compose. Please note that this setup is not recommended for production use.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to install Docker and Docker Compose. You can download them using the following links:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Configuration

1. Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file and update the values to match your setup. The values from the `.env` file will be used to populate the database connection details on the install page. You should not need to change these unless your setup requires different values.

   **Note:** Docker Compose creates a network for your application, and each service (container) in the Docker Compose file can reach each other via the service name. This is why the `DB_HOST` value in the `.env` file and on the install page should match the service name of the database in the `docker-compose.yml` file. For example, if the database service in `docker-compose.yml` is defined as `db`, then `DB_HOST` should be set as 'db'. This allows the application to communicate with the database service on its internal docker network.

## Starting the Development Environment

To start the development environment, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

# Running Cypress Tests Locally

Follow these steps to run the Cypress tests locally on your machine:

1. **Clone the repository**

   If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine

2. **Setup .env file**

   Copy the sample `.env` file and adjust it to your local environment:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

3. **Build Docker services**

   Build and start the Docker services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Install Cypress**

   Navigate into the project directory and install Cypress:

   ```bash
   npm install cypress
   ```

5. **Run the Cypress tests**

   After the installation is complete, you can run the Cypress tests:

   ```bash
   npx cypress run
   ```

## Support

Cloudlog has two support systems for code issues use Github issues, however if you have general issues with setting up your server please use our general discussion forum [https://github.com/magicbug/Cloudlog/discussions](https://github.com/magicbug/Cloudlog/discussions).

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within Cloudlog, please send an e-mail to Peter Goodhall, MM9SQL via [peter@magicbug.co.uk](mailto:peter@magicbug.co.uk). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Want Cloudlog Hosting?

If you would prefer not to setup Cloudlog yourself [magicbug](https://magicbug.co.uk) offer hosted solutions, this is priced at Â£4 a month at the moment and they take care of keeping it updated.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute in any way to Cloudlog, it is most appreciated. This has been developed in free time, help coding new features or writing documentation is always useful.

Please note that Cloudlog was built using [Codeigniter](https://www.codeigniter.com/userguide3/) version 3 and uses [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) as the frontend toolkit.

We also [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) for AJAX requests and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for some of the frontend functionality. We use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons.

At the moment we use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing.

When submitting PRs please make sure code is commented and includes one feature only, multiple features or bug fixes will not be accepted. Please include a description of what your PR does and why it is needed.
